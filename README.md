    <table>
        <tr>          
          <td style="text-align: center">

  * User can submit the form only once per day.
  * The app keeps track of which symptoms every user submitted and then increments the symptom counters in the database.
  	* This way the admin has record of what % of users displayed the specific symptom that day.


#### Add notes on how you have been feeling lately

You can keep a diary of your daily symptoms, apart from the symptoms survey, this way you can track your recovery!
